## Hi, I'm Adam! 👋

👨‍💻 **Backend Developer**, passionate about empowering youth and making a positive community impact through technology. With experience in **Python, Django, AWS, and Docker**, I have the skills to build backend infrastructures that encourage young people to engage in positive actions and community service.

### 🌍 About Me
🚀 Currently leading the **VOLUNTEEN** initiative, a web app designed to boost youth engagement in community projects. Through VOLUNTEEN, teenagers complete tasks like helping families or visiting patients, earning points redeemable for rewards at local businesses. Supported by a yearly 20K budget from the Jaffa council, and we're in talks for a collaboration with the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality. I also collaborate with the Yafa Al-Mustaqbal School, where I teach advanced math, aiming to strengthen students' social engagement and academic success.

### 👥 Future Goals
I aspire to join a company with a meaningful mission, where I can contribute my backend skills to create scalable, impactful solutions. My goal is to advance to technical leadership roles, guiding teams to create technologies that positively influence the world.
