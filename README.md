## Hi, I'm Adam! 👋

👨‍💻 **Junior Backend Developer** from Jaffa, passionate about empowering youth and making a positive community impact through technology. With experience in **Python, Django, AWS, and Docker**, I have the skills to build backend infrastructures that encourage young people to engage in positive actions and community service.

### 🌍 About Me
🚀 Currently leading the **VOLUNTEEN** initiative, a web app designed to boost youth engagement in community projects. Through VOLUNTEEN, teenagers complete tasks like helping families or visiting patients, earning points redeemable for rewards at local businesses. Supported by a yearly 20K budget from the Jaffa council, and we're in talks for a collaboration with the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality. I also collaborate with the Yafa Al-Mustaqbal School, where I teach advanced math, aiming to strengthen students' social engagement and academic success.

⚽ Beyond VOLUNTEEN, I developed **Foot Manager**, a task management platform for coaches, enabling them to create and track tasks, monitor players’ performances, and manage team activities.

🌐 Previously, I led the **"Gateway to High-Tech"** program at Muna Association, where I introduced advanced technologies to students at two schools in Jaffa, helping them develop essential tech skills.

📚 I’m currently pursuing a **Computer Science degree** at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo. During my studies, I’ve created advanced projects, including a **Taki game in C** and a **Facebook-like platform in C++**. As a second-year student, I joined the honors program, opening up further professional and research opportunities.

### 👥 Future Goals
I aspire to join a company with a meaningful mission, where I can contribute my backend skills to create scalable, impactful solutions. My goal is to advance to technical leadership roles, guiding teams to create technologies that positively influence the world.

### 🏅 Personal Interests
Outside of tech, I'm a professional football player since 2013 and have captained my team for six seasons. I am dedicated to volunteering and mentoring young people, believing that contributing to society helps reinforce my values and drive positive change.
